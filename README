experimenting with dimensionality reduction via a random projection

can reduce A (ixj) to size A' (ixk) (k<j)
by AB=A' when B (jxk) has random values with each column vector being unit length

requires ggplot2
R> install.packages("ggplot2")

$ ./project_two_circles.rb
look at pngs

$ ./project_triangle.rb
look at pngs

blognotes:
- dimensionality reduction
- random projection
- why bother?
 - reduced size; feature hashing => fixed size
 - turns sparse into dense allowing item comparison that might have otherwise not been possible
